# Time Series Forecasting Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate and compare different time series forecasting models to predict future values based on historical data. The models tested include **ARIMA**, **SARIMAX**, **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **XGBoost**. The performance of each model is assessed using evaluation metrics such as **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**, **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**, and **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**. The goal is to identify the most suitable model for accurate time series predictions.
